I just came across an entry in [www.tivoblog.com](http://www.tivoblog.com/) where the author describes his experiences with [Crossbar Media's AV Cast system](http://www.crossbarmedia.com/html/media_kit.html). It looks pretty interesting, but at that cost you'd almost buy a second TiVo recorder at $99, and add a wireless adapter for about $50.

Still, it could allow for faster viewing of programs, even with two TiVo's linked together in the same room, with a wired network. It could even take away the need for having a cable box and TiVo recorder in the bedroom.
