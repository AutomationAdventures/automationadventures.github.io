TiVo announced their latest goodie: [TiVo HME](http://www.tivo.com/4.3.hme.asp).

The HME is a SDK (yeah I know, TLA's all over the place), allowing third-party applications to make use of the TiVo display. It looks like [JavaHMO,](http://javahmo.sourceforge.net/) but with the added integration the possibilities seem limitless. The SDK download includes the early adopters version of the kit, a couple of sample applications, and a desktop simulator to test out your applications. You'll need TiVo 7.1 to use HME.

The [sample screens](http://tivohme.sourceforge.net/?page=screenshots) look stunning. This could be very big, and I think TiVo sees this as their next step in software development. They've set up a developer's challenge as well.

Meanwhile, several forums have popped up describing HME. One is a spin-off from the PVR Blog, the [HME PVR Blog](http://hme.pvrblog.com/). Another is a forum on [tivocommunity.com](http://www.tivocommunity.com/), listed under the Underground Playground. Both (and others I've undoubtedly missed) look very interesting, and I'll most certainly will give HME a whirl over the weekend!
