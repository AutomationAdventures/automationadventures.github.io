Yesterday I came across a couple of posts stating that TiVo is now supporting 802.11g adapters. A quick check revealed that the [Supported Wireless Adapaters](http://customersupport.tivo.com/knowbase/root/public/tv2184.htm?) page at TiVo support now shows 2 G-adapters: the [D-Link DWL-G120](http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=268) and the [NetGear WG111](http://www.netgear.com/products/details/WG111.php). Both require version 7.1a of the TiVo software (i.e. the software on your TiVo). Monitor the supported adapters pages for correct versions of these adapters.

I checked, and BestBuy has a deal on the NetGear WG111: the in-store price is $59.99, with a total of $40 of mail-in rebates. Check your stores for the details...

Of course I rushed out and grabbed one, just to test this out. Unfortunately I didn't have a lot of time last night, and a simple substitute of one wireless adapter for another doesn't quite work. I'll have to play around with it a little more tonight!

Several people on the [tivocommunity.com](http://www.tivocommunity.com/) forum (including TivoBill) report that there is little or no speed increase when using 802.11g - yet. This may be resolved in future versions.
