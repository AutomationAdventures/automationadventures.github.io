A beta version of [Galleon](http://sourceforge.net/projects/galleon/) has been released. This is made by the same developer as [JavaHMO](http://javahmo.sourceforge.net/) (Leon Nicholls), and utilizes the [HME](http://tivohme.sourceforge.net/) from TiVo.

This version sports no JavaHMO plug ins as yet, but the list of features looks pretty impressive. Download a copy of it and try it out...!
