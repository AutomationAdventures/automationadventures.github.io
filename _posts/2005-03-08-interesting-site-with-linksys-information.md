While browsing the TiVo community, and trying to find a solution for my still not working Netgear WG111, I came across some posts describing how to use two LinkSys WRT54G routers and create a bridge. The post included a link to a site dedicated to the LinkSys line of network equipment: [LinksysInfo.](http://www.linksysinfo.org/)

You don't need to register to use many of the features, but please do, and if possible, make a donation. This site has either the information you're looking for, or people on the boards can point you in the right direction.

I'm looking for a similar site for Netgear...
