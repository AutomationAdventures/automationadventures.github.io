[iSee iTunes](http://homepage.mac.com/kylecopeland/FileSharing11.html) is a cool little application using TiVo HME. It allows you to control the iTunes program on your computer, changing playlists and rating the songs that are being played.

It does not play any songs through the TiVo. To actually hear the music you need to hook up an Airtunes unit or something similar. However, if I'm not mistaken the last version of JavaHMO was capable of using iTunes, and iTunes playlists. Wouldn't it be great if these two programs could somehow be combined...?
