[The Street](http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/stocks/media/10213207.html) reports that Tuesday TiVo and ComCast announced that they will develop a new DVR with TiVo, that should be available to ComCast viewers by mid to late 2006.

This might put any rumours of TiVo's death to rest... and apparently it is not just The Street reporting it: The Wall Street Journal reports something similar, although I can't check it since the WSJ requires a registration.

Edited:  
It's official, even on [TiVo's](http://www.tivo.com/5.3.1.1.asp?article=246) and [Comcast's](http://www.cmcsk.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=147565&p=irol-newsArticle&t=Regular&id=685606&) website. Apparently this is the news everybody was waiting for: the [shares of TiVo](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=t&s=TIVO) went up about 75%...!
