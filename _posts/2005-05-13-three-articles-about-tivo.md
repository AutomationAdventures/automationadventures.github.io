[MediaDialyNews](http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=PublicationsHome.showHomePage) published a series of three articles about Tivo, "What TiVo People Know":

  1. [What TiVo People Know, Part I](http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&art_aid=29962) 
  2. [What TiVo People Know, Part II](http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&art_aid=29963) 
  3. [What TiVo People Know, Part III - A Modest Proposal](http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&art_aid=29964)

The first article roughly describes what has been available in the past to record programs, and how the TiVo differs from it. The second article describes more of the benefits of the TiVo. The third acrticle is the most interesting - it describes how to adopt the ability to skip commercials to a new advertising strategy.

The articles are written by Cece Forrester, a media planner in Chicago.
