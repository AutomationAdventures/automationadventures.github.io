Google released their [Enterprise edition](http://desktop.google.com/enterprise/index.html) of the Desktop Search tool they released in October last year. Not exactly Home Automation, but maybe of interest to people who got hooked on it using it at home but weren't allowed to use it in the workplace.

I've been using it since last year, and it works great - even helped me find a file on my machine when I was sure I didn't have it...
