Life moves pretty fast... (thanks [Ferris](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091042/). I'm just going through some of the snippets that I collected over the last couple of weeks, and I came across this short list of Tivo Tips and Tweaks, called [Secret TiVo Tips and Tweaks](http://news.yahoo.com/s/pcworld/121087;_ylt=AoCtykdvLgtTpXQYfoKV3sIDW7oF;_ylu=X3oDMTBiMW04NW9mBHNlYwMlJVRPUCUl) by Yahoo! News. There's not a lot of secrecy about them, but some are really cool (I didn't know about the Easter Egg they mention). Check it out, have fun with them and see which ones you find really useful.
