Yay! I finally got one for my birthday (June 9th - thanks... no, I don't mind, 41), a 30Gb [iPod Photo](http://www.apple.com/ipodphoto/). This is a really sleek piece of hardware - about the size of my wallet without the usual accumulation of receipts, notes and business cards.

I've managed to squeeze all of my CD's on it, using a whopping 10Gb of the device. So, what to do with the other 20Gb? Hey, [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/) has some really cool music... and is expanding daily.

But the really cool thing I use the iPod for during travel (car and plane) are the [Podcasts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting). [The Daily Sourcecode](http://www.dailysourcecode.com/) by Adam Curry is just fun to listen to (bringing back memories of Curry and Van Inkel), and on a recent business trip to Orlando I was listening to a 2 hour show by [Leo Laporte](http://www.leoville.com/) of The Screensavers fame. You have to be careful when you listen to this stuff with headphones on - people around you may think you're mental when you start giggling...:)

Once again, not really a Home Automation post, more a post about what I've been playing around with for the last couple of weeks... and of course, the podcasting is automation in the sense that it is sort of a TiVo for Radio...
