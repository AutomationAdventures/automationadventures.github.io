![iTunes Podcasts](/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/iTunes-20Podcasts.jpg)  
This morning Apple released version 4.9 of [Apple - iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/). Amongst the new features are subscribing to [PodCasts](http://www.apple.com/podcasting/). The subscription system is really easy - I'm transferring my subscriptions from iPodder to iTunes. However, there seems to be a bandwidth issue with some of the podcasts: I can't seem to get Adam Curry's Daily Source Code or the Gillmore Gang. Everything else seems to be trickling in slowly. To the left is a screenshot of my current Podcast directory in iTunes. On the iPod they show up in the Podcast directory of the Playlists section.

I think Apple is making an excellent decision by integrating the Podcasts into iTunes. Sampling or subscribing to a Podcast is just as simple as adding music to your shopping cart, using the same directory structure.

By the way, you did notice that [Blogger now supports pictures](http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=324) right...?
