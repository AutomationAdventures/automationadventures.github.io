[Skyllian](http://skyllian.fmdm.org/) is a Skype plug-in for Trillian. I'm not sure as what the feature set is (can't seem to find a documentation file out there), but it looks promising. I've recently joined the [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) revolution, and I must say the quality is amazing. If anyone is using Skyllian, I'd like to hear what your experiences with it are...
