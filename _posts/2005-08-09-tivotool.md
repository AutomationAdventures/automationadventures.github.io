[TivoTool](http://www.tivotool.com/) is a TivoToGo program for Mac OS X and Linux users. On the Mac it seems to integrate very nicely with iTunes (I don't think it will do the same on Linux... ðŸ™‚ ). It does require you to 'hack' your Tivo by applying a couple of patches and installing vserver on your box... so if you're not ready for that, wait for the official release of TivoToGo for Mac (which may not be that far away - considering Tivo is trying to [hire a Mac programmer](http://www.tivo.com/cms_static/job_82.html)).
