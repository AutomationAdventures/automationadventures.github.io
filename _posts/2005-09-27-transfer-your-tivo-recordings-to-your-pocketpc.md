Information Week has a review about [TiVo in your Pocket](http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=171200788), describing how to transfer your TiVo recordings to a PocketPC. Unfortunately, my trusty old iPAQ only has 64Mb, so there's very little room for video's. Let's see if we can convince the wife we need more memory..:)
