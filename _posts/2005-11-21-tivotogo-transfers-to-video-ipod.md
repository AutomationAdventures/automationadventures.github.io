I should get started earlier on Mondays... [Several](http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2005/11/tivo_is_coming_.html) [sources](http://ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/tivo-adds-ipod-support-to-tivotogo-service/) have reported that TiVo is going to support transfers to video iPods and Sony PSP's. A beta is available starting today, and a general release is scheduled for early next year.

The downside is that the transfer process is far from fast - apparently TiVo suggests syncing overnight. Add to that the time to transfer your shows from the TiVo to your PC, and this may take a while. I suspect that the added copyright-measures (apparently the video transferred to your iPod will include a digital watermark) is largely responsible for the slow process... maybe they'll be able to improve that by next year.
