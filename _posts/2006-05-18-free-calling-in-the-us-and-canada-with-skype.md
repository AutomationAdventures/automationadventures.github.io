Most everybody has heard by now that Skype has [free calling within the US and Canada](http://www.skype.com/help/guides/skypeout.html), until the end of 2006. I've been toying with the idea to get a Vonage or Skype setup at home, and this was the tipping point. Good call, Skype... ðŸ™‚

To make everything work as seemless as possible, I've also ordered the [VoSKY Internet Phone Wizard](http://us.accessories.skype.com/direct/skypeusa/itemdetl.jsp?prod=3071). This little gizmo should make it possible to use both Skype and regular POST lines with our cordless phone. The VoSKY should be coming in today or tomorrow, and I'll post my experiences with it ASAP.
