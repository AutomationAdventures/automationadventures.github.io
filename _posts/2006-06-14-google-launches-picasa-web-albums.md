Google has once again launched a new service, called [Picasa Web Albums](http://picasaweb.google.com/). This is Google's answer to Flickr and Yahoo! Photo's, integrated with the Picasa software running on your desktop.

Interestingly enough, this is not touted as Beta, but rather as...

The only limitation (apart from it being invitation-only) is that the storage space is limited to 250MB of free storage. For $25 per year you can get an additional 6GB of storage. The system requirements section leaves out the fact that Picasa is also available for Linux.

It looks like an interesting alternative, and I'll definately sign up for an invitation. I like the Picasa software, and even got my wife to use it, so this would be a natural extension of the photo experience.
