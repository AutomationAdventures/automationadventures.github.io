Well, it's been about a month now that we've been using the [Actiontec Internet Phone Wizard](http://us.accessories.skype.com/direct/skypeusa/itemdetl.jsp?prod=3071) with [Skype](http://www.skype.com/), and it seems to be working OK.

My wife has used it for a couple of long-distance calls to family in the States, and some of those calls last up to 1 1/2 hours (she's a professional talker...). I've used it to call family overseas, and the only complaints we've heard is the occasional stutter in the speech, and on one overseas call there was a hollow sound to the phone call.

The hardest thing is to remember to set up a speed dial code for a long-distance phone number - meaning there is a limit of 100 numbers you can set up as well. An incidental call cannot be made without setting up a speed dial code - unless I missed something in the documentation.

One gripe about the setup is that you have to be logged in to Windows to use the Phone Wizard and Skype. It would be nice to run this all as a service or something. For now, I think I have to resort to an automatic login (I remember seeing an option for that in Windows XP somewhere).

All in all, I like the Phone Wizard. There is room for improvement, but the quality is good, and you can't be the cost of Skype...!
