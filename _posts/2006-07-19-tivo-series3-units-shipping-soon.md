[Zatznotfunny](http://www.zatznotfunny.com/) has an [installation page](http://www.zatznotfunny.com/2006-07/tivo-confirms-series3-testing-hitting-retail-soon/) for CableCARDs in the upcoming TiVo Series 3 receivers. Also on the page is an excerpt from a letter from TiVo to the FCC and cable operators, informing them of the capability of the Series3 to accept up to two CableCARDs, and that the product is currently being test and will be generally available soon.  
If only Charter Communications would make the CableCARD available in our area (southwest Virginia)...:)
