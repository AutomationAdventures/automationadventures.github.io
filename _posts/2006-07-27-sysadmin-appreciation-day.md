Just a reminder for all users out there: hug your sysadmin tomorrow. July 29th is [System Administrator Appreciation Day.](http://www.sysadminday.com/)  
Although in every day life I'm a programmer, I also manage a Linux server running a Wiki (amongst other things), two HP-UX machines that run our main databases (although I might be considered more of an operator/victim there), and of course several computers at home. So I feel connected to SysAdmin Day, in a small way.  
A shout-out to the guys at [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/), who have kept this blog and thousands of others running. Thanks guys.  
And to all the SysAdmins who keep the websites I visit on a daily basis running: [Digg](http://digg.com/), [SlashDot](http://slashdot.org/), [The Dilbert Blog](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/), [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com/), [Wired](http://www.wired.com/), and last but not least the [Shawn Hogan Fan Club](http://www.digitalpoint.com/~shawn).  
Happy SysAdmin Day!
