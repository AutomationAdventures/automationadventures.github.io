On August 3rd, Apple announced that Ford, General Motors and Mazda, will include iPod connections on most 2007 models. This means they join the likes of Honda, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, which already sport these connections.  
This means you don't have to resort to a tape-deck or FM radio adapter anymore. Plus you will be able to control the iPod from your regular audio controls, making it more convenient and safer than having the iPod laying around in a cup holder.  
This means I'm definately going to hold off on buying a new car until the 2007 models come out... ðŸ™‚
