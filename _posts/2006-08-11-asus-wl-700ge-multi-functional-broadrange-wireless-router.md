Via [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/wireless/asus-wl700ge-wifi-router-builtin-160gb-drive-itunes-and-bittorrent-193470.php) I came across the [Asus Wl-700gE](http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1=12&l2=43&l3=0&model=979&modelmenu=1), a remarkable router.

  * Built-in 160GB Harddrive
  * USB 2.0 connections for external hard drive or thumb drives
  * Efficient heat dissipation via special airflow design
  * Plug in a USB memory device and use easy file transfer with AUTO COPY
  * Support for sharing files (also music, video and/or photos!) both within and outside the network - the last with special accounts you can set up.
  * DDNS support and Web server
  * DHCP server + Samba Server/Local disk
  * Automatic download of files - even with the PC off. Supports BitTorrent, http and ftp protocols.
  * Digital Home Information Center - even supports music files via iTunes - making it possible to use the WL-700gE as iTunes "server".
  * Support to build web pages on the router.
  * Supports 802.11b/g - no word on 802.11n support.
  * The Broadrange aspect increases signal coverage by 300%

Unfortunately no word on prices yet... but this looks an awesome piece of equipment. It doesn't look bigger than a regular router, but it packs a lot more punch.  
<u>Update</u>: The Gizmodo article has a link to the [Ubergizmo article](http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2006/08/asus_wl700ge_wifi_router.html), where it mentions a price of $500.
