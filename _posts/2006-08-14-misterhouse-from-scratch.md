Ron Klinkien has set up a Wiki called [MisterHouse from Scratch](http://mrhousefromscratch.tk/), where he describes his experiences with setting up the Home Automation software [MisterHouse](http://misterhouse.net/).  
He describes all the steps he had to take, the tips and tricks he learned along the way, and a lot of under-the-hood details on how to configure Linux, MisterHouse and several accessories he attached to his Home Automation box.  
A very interesting read for anyone interested in Home Automation, and a must for anyone setting up MisterHouse.
