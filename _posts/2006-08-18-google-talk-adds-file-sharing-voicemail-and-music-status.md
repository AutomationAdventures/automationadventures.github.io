[The Google Talk blog](http://googletalk.blogspot.com/) [announced](http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2006/08/its-finally-here.html) that Google Talk has been updated. If you're using Google Talk now, it should automatically update over the next few days. If you can't wait or are a new user. you can download it [here](http://www.google.com/talk/).  
File sharing is done by dropping one or more files onto a chat window. These files can been regular files, but also photos or music. If you drop photos on the chat window, it will show smaller previews of the photos immediately. And you're not limited to just files - you can share whole folders.  
Voicemail is pretty standard: if the person you're trying to reach isn't there to answer, you can leave a voicemail message instead. Interesting is that the voicemail is sent as an email attachement to them, so they can listen to the voicemail whenever they check their email.  
Music Status and Music Trends allow Google Talk to show what you're currently listening to, and submits that information to Google Music Trends. Whenever your song in one of the supported players (currently iTunes, Windows Media Player, Winamp, and Yahoo Music Engine) changes, Google Talk changes too.  
Interesting new features - I'll definately play around a bit with the new Google Talk!
