[Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/) has an [article](http://www.engadget.com/2006/08/22/tivo-series-3-beta-box-snapped-in-the-wild/) with pictures of the new series 3 TiVo in beta test. Still very beta (it doesn't seem to have TivoToGo), but it seems to sport 2 CableCARDs. Can't wait to get my hands on one of those babies once they are released!
