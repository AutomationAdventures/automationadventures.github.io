I'm trying it - again. Maybe this time Linux Desktop is ready for me.

After reading all the good reviews on Ubuntu Linux, I've decided to switch. Taking stock of the applications that I use on a regular basis that are not linked to web browsing or E-mail:

  * <a href="http://www.quicken.com/" target="_blank">Quicken</a>
  * <a href="http://cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/vpndevc/index.html" target="_blank">Cisco VPN</a>
  * <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" target="_blank">iTunes</a>
  * <a href="http://www.tivo.com/4.9.4.1.asp" target="_blank">TiVo Desktop</a>

The day before I was going to make the actual switch we were browsing through a bookstore and I ran across <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596527209/sr=8-1/qid=1156440771/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-3473930-1256141?ie=UTF8" target="_blank">Ubuntu Hacks</a>, a book with 100 tips and tricks for beginners and experts. It had some interesting hacks in there that I could apply, most notably a step by step on installing several virtual machines.  
After looking through some of the descriptions I decided on <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/server/" target="_blank">VMWare Server</a>. This is a free download, and an amazing product. As opposed to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtualpc/default.mspx" target="_blank">Windows Virtual machine</a>, I didn't have any <a href="/2006/07/windows-genuine-advantage-fails-on-virtual-pc.html" target="_blank">issues with the Windows Genuine Advantage</a> tool installation. Plus I love the fact that I now have an image of Windows that is completely pristine, no applications installed, that I can use to rebuild a Windows machine in minutes.  
Installing Quicken was a bit of challenge, since I misplaced my installation disk. Once located, it was a breeze.  
I haven't installed anything else yet, since it's the thick of summer down here, and yardwork and relaxation are also important, but I can't wait to get my hands back on the box.
