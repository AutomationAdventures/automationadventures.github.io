[Wired magazine](http://www.wired.com/) has [an article](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71682-0.html?tw=rss.index) summing up the pros and cons of CableCard technology. CableCards are essential to the TiVo Series 3 (it sports 2 CableCard slots), and a recent federal appeals court ruling requires cable companies to support them.  
In short:  
Advantages:

  * No cable box needed
  * Can be sent through mail
  * No need for kludges like an [IR blaster](http://customersupport.tivo.com/knowbase/root/public/tv1047.htm)

Disadvantages:

  * One-way system (although CC 2.0 fixes that)

I'm curious to see when Charter... er.. SuddenLink starts to support CableCards...!
