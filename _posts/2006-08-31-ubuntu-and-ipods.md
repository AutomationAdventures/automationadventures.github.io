Of course, after finally breaking down last night and installing [Codeweaver](http://www.codeweavers.com/)'s [CrossOver Office](http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxoffice/) to install iTunes, today I see [this article](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9266) in Linux Journal on how to use your iPod with Ubuntu.

The article shows a few options to sync music, and also explains how to sync photos and change the default application that's opened when you plug in the iPod.

A worthwhile read, and something to try out tonight...
