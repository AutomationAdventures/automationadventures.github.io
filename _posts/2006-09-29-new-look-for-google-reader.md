[Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/view/) has [changed their look](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/09/your-inbox-for-web.html). And it's a big improvement.

Big change I see is the categories you can put your feeds in, and you can read them by category. That's the one big thing I missed when I switched from bloglines.  
It has the same setup as GMail: you can have All Items, Starred Items, etc. etc.  
You can list all your subscriptions, or list only the ones that have updated items.

It looks like it is still in "Labs" status, but I feel they're ready to make it "Beta" ðŸ™‚
