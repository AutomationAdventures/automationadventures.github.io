So, on [September 30th](/2006/09/and-were-back.html), I write this post making all kinds of excuses why I haven't posted in a while, and that I'll do better. And of course, now I feel like crap, since I haven't done better.

Therefore, no more excuses, and I'm going to schedule time every day to at least pick a top story I've read that day to blog about.

And if I don't... well... sorry..?
