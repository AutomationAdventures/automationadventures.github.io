TiVo announced in a [press release](http://www.tivo.com/cms_static/press_115.html) today that the newest version of their Desktop software, TiVo Desktop Plus 2.4, will allow users to convert any (free) video from formats such as QuickTime, Windows Media Video, and MPEG-4, into the format used by TiVo for playing recordings.

The software will be a one-time purchase of $24.95, and will be a free upgrade to owners of 2.3. The [TiVo Desktop](http://www.tivo.com/4.9.4.1.asp) page doesn't show the new version yet, but I assume this is the page it will appear on.

Depending how automated this is, this will finally allow me to watch the video podcast [diggnation](http://revision3.com/diggnation) on our TV!
