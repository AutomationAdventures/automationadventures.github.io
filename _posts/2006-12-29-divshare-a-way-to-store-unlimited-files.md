I ran across a new file sharing site, called [divShare](http://www.divshare.com/). It claims it's a free file hosting service for everyone, no registration required - but if you register, you get access to the 'advanced' options.

Apparently there is no file size limit, and no limit on the time a file can be stored there. Is this the perfect backup site for your hard disk (although you may want to encrypt your backup...)?
