This article was promoted to the [Digg](http://digg.com/linux_unix/Using_your_iPod_on_Linux) front page recently: [Using your iPod on Linux](http://www.codejacked.com/using-your-ipod-on-linux/). At first I was excited - maybe there is some useful information in this article!

Unfortunately, it turns out to be a simple three step article, showing how to install gtkpod, how to start it, and how to sync your music between gtkpod and your iPod. The comments point out some of the shortcomings, like video files, purchasing from the iTunes Music Store, etc.

I'm staying with [Banshee](http://www.banshee-project.org/) for now!
