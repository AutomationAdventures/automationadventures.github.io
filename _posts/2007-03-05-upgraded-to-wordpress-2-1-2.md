Sorry if there was a short period where the website seemed to be in a state of flux - I just upgraded to [WordPress 2.1.2](http://wordpress.org/download). Pretty painless upgrade, [Adsense 0.8](http://www.acmetech.com/blog/adsense-deluxe/) still works, [WordPress DB Backup 1.7](http://www.skippy.net/blog/category/wordpress/plugins/wp-db-backup/) has been replaced with a [2.0.1 version](http://www.ilfilosofo.com/blog/2007/01/22/wordpress-database-backup-re-release-version-20/), [Akismet](http://codex.wordpress.org/Akismet) was upgraded, and WP Cron was retired (the new WordPress has a semi-cron version).

The only plugin not carried forward seems to be Digg This 1.0 - but I don't think I got it working in the old version either, so no big loss there.

Please post a comment if you find anything working strange in the new system, and have fun!
