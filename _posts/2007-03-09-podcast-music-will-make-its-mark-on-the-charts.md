For the past year or two I've been listening to a lot of podcasts, including Adam Curry's [Daily Source Code](http://dailysourcecode.com/) (and Leo Laporte's [This Week in Tech](http://www.twit.tv/TWiT) and [Security Now!](http://www.twit.tv/SN)). I've been lagging behind a bit, and just listened to the February 19th episode. In it, Adam mentions a great initiative from Mark Yoshimoto Nemcoff (of [Pacific Coast Hellway fame](http://www.pacificcoasthellway.com/)), called [Bumrush The Charts](http://bumrushthecharts.blogspot.com/).

The idea is to prove that podcasting can make an impact, and deserves more respect from the traditional media. So, on March 22nd, we'll try to take an indie podsafe music artist (Black Lab) to number one on the iTunes singles charts as a demonstration of the power of podcasting.
