I just picked up a neat little utility called [gSyncit](http://www.daveswebsite.com/software/gsync/). It's a plugin for Outlook 2003 and higher (including Outlook 2007!), and synchronizes your Microsoft Outlook calendar with Google Calendar.

It seems to work pretty smooth. Just remember that your Google login name might contain `@gmail.com`... ðŸ™‚
