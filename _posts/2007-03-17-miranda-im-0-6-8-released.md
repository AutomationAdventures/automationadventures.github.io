I just received notice (even though it was released March 13th...) that [Miranda](http://www.miranda-im.org/) has done a [minor upgrade](http://www.miranda-im.org/2007/03/13/miranda-im-v068-released/) from 0.6.7 to 0.6.8.

Miranda is an instant messenger with multiple protocol support, like AIM, Yahoo, MSN, and Google Talk. Version 0.6.8 has a few bug fixes for AIM, Jabber (Google), and MSN support.

If you have never used Miranda, give it a try. It's Windows only, but that's OK - still stuck with a Windows workstation at work (oh how appropriate... oh well).
