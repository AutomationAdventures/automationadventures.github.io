Josh Kuo has an [interesting article](http://www.qbangsolutions.com/blog/index.php/2007/02/26/beef-up-your-wireless-router/) about giving your old Linksys a new lease on life with the [OpenWRT](http://openwrt.org/) project. Some of the options after installing OpenWRT: 

* Install asterisk
* VoIP
* router/firewall on steroids with nmap, snort, and tcpdump
* VPN with openvpn
* Wireless hotspot with chilispot, FreeRadius and WPA.
* All-purpose office server with DHCP, cups, lighthttpd, NTP

OpenWRT is not officially released - its current version is Release Candidate 6.
