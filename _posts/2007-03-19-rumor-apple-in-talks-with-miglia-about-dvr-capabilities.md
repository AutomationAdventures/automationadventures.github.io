When [Apple TV](http://www.apple.com/appletv/) was launched, arguably the biggest complaint was that you couldn't record your own shows with it. Now it seems Apple is thinking about doing a HD DVR, but the limitation seems to be the internal 40Gb hard disk.

Enter the USB ports on the Apple TV. What if you could hook up an external hard disk? [Miglia](http://www.miglia.com/) seems to [provide](http://miglia.com/Support/appletv.html) the functionality Apple is looking for. However, making iTunes recognize that external USB drive may means some serious software integration, and it wouldn't be in Apple's best interest to leave Miglia completely independent.
