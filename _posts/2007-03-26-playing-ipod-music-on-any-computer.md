[Floola](http://floola.com/) is a cross-platform applications to play music from your iPod on any computer. It is now up to beta 34, which adds podcast support. The only time a platform choice comes into play is when downloading the installer: there are packages for Linux, Windows (98 and up), and Mac OS X (10.2 and above).

The only problem is that DRM'ed tunes cannot be played. For that, we suggest using [QT Fair Use](http://hymn-project.org/download.php).

Thanks to [GHacks](http://www.ghacks.net/tag/itunes/) for the links.
