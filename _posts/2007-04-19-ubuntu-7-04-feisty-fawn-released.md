Ubuntu 7.04 (nicknamed "Feisty Fawn") is officially released. The [Ubuntu main page](http://www.ubuntu.com/) still mentions 6.10 as the latest version as of this moment, but you can download the various versions [here](http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/). I'm 25% into the download now, and will let you know what it looks like in a bit.
