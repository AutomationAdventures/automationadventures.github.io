When I was browsing around the [Apple site](http://www.apple.com/), and wanted to find out what the price for an 8GB iPod Nano was, I was presented with the "We'll be back soon" page.

Apparently Apple is updating the [store](http://store.apple.com/) for a new product?

"We are busy updating the store for you and will be back shortly."

Mid-may, too early for the iPhone, OS X doesn't have an update due... I'm curious!
