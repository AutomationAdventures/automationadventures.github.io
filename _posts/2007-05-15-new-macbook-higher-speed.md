The reason the Apple store was down for maintenance? [New MacBooks](http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html). Or, more accurately, the same MacBooks, but with a new processor.

**Update**: there's a [press release](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/15macbook.html), describing the changes in more detail:

  1. Faster Intel Core Duo processors (2.0GHz or 2.16GHz)
  2. 1GB of memory
  3. Larger hard drives (80, 120 or 160 GB)

Prices start at $1099 for the smallest model, and go up to $1499 for the (black) top-of-the-line model.
