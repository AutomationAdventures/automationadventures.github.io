[Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com/) has updated a cool little utility [Adam Pash](http://adampash.org/) has developed, called [Swept Away](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/featured-windows-download/de+clutter-your-virtual-desktop-with-swept-away-260917.php).

Swept Away monitors your open windows, and whenever a window hasn't been used for a user-defined number of seconds (default 300 = 5 minutes), it automatically minimizes the window. This not only helps you keep an uncluttered view of your desktop, but in some cases the minimized program actually uses less memory (think Firefox with [the trim on minimize tweak](http://lifehacker.com/software/firefox/cut-down-on-firefox-memory-hogging-254092.php)).

The new version adds a user-defined monitoring interval (default 300 milliseconds), and some bug fixes.
