It looks like all went well with the upgrade to [WordPress 2.2.](http://wordpress.org/)

I may change the design a little over the next week or so, to take advantage of the new [plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins) option in 2.2. This makes maintaining the site much easier (i.e. no need to hack into PHP code to add a small functionality to a sidebar).
