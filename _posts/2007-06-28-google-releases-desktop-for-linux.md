The [Google Desktop](http://desktop.google.com/) has been released as a [Linux version](http://desktop.google.com/linux/index.html) as of this week.  
All the familiar features of the Windows version are there:

  * Quick search by pressing the Ctrl key twice
  * Smart indexing
  * File versioning
  * Integration with Google websearch

You can download the Linux version [here](http://desktop.google.com/linux/download.html). It requires glibc 2.3.2 or higher, and gtk+ 2.2.0 or higher.
