I think Apple is still peeved about Cisco suing them over the iPhone name.

Apparently they are now taking revenge by knocking Cisco's Wireless Access Points off-line. [Or at least, so says Duke University](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/071607-duke-iphone.html). According to the IT department at Duke, the iPhones periodically flood the school's WLAN with MAC address requests, knocking several access points off-line for 10 to 15 minutes.

Duke has submitted a trouble ticket with Apple, because Cisco claims the problem is not on their end.

Personally, I think Apple found the perfect DDOS attack against Cisco. Cisco may need to revise their opinion, and fix this possible Denial of Service.
