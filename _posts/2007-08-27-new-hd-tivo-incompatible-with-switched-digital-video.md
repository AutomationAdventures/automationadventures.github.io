The newest offering from [TiVo](http://www.tivo.com/), the [HD DVR](http://tivo.com/whatistivo/tivohd/index.html), might suffer from a problem when your cable provider uses Switched Digital Video (SDV).

[This blog post](http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000273.html) on Lauren Weinstein's blog signals a problem that might prevent the new HD TiVo's, that are using CableCARDs to receive the channels, from receiving all channels when your cable provider is using SDV.

As it happens, two days after that blog post, the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA) [made a filing](http://ibc.broadcastnewsroom.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=175784) with the FCC according to Lauren's [follow-up post](http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000275.html). However, this solution (the OpenCable option) doesn't sit well with the Consumer Electronics Association, who find the solution unduly expensive and cumbersome to develop.

Until a final solution is developed, the users of the Tivo HD DVR might have to resort to the old method of infrared switching of their cable boxes, instead of relying on the CableCARD technology...
