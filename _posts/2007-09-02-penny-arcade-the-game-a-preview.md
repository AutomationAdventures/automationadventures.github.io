Wired has a [sneak peak](http://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/multimedia/2007/08/mf_penny_ss) at the first computer game of Penny Arcade, _Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness: Episode I_. Besides the familiar [Penny Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com/) humor, this game is special in that it will be released in episodes, only available directly from the PA website.

Each episode will presumably be cheaper than a complete game, therefore lowering the threshold for buyers. However, it also puts a lot of pressure on each episode: make one bad episode, and you might lose some of your fans, resulting in lower sales.

I'm looking forward to the game, especially after seeing some of the screen shots: they capture the comic's style perfectly. And it will probably be my only chance to ever see the Fruit Fucker in action...
