I just received an email from Chumby Industries, informing that the [Chumby](http://www.chumby.com/) is now shipping to a select group of customers. If you want to buy one, sign up on the [store page](http://www.chumby.com/store).

Meanwhile, while you're waiting for your Chumby to be delivered, or waiting for it to become available, you can play around with the Chumby-on-the-Net. Below is an example of the Chumby I just created:

<embed bgcolor="#FFFFFF" flashvars="_chumby_profile_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chumby.com%2Fxml%2Fvirtualprofiles%2F4E98715C-83D0-11DC-ADDE-0030488E34F8&baseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chumby.com" height="405" name="virtualchumby" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="http://www.chumby.com/virtualchumby2.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="492" wmode="transparent">

It looks like a really nice combination of digital photo frame and web widgets. There are [widgets](http://www.chumby.com/guide) to display your Flickr photos, weather info, stock alerts, etc. The widgets take turns on the display, based on their settings. To have the Chumby operate, you need a Wifi connection and (unfortunately) an AC outlet.

The Chumby [ships](http://www.chumby.com/store) for a little under $200.
