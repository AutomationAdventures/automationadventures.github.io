There was a small outage today as I was upgrading various parts of the website to WordPress 2.3.1. It actually took a lot longer than expected, caused in part by the refusal of GoDaddy to accept two FTP connections from the same IP address. Plus, when I came back after transferring the new version, there was an error box waiting for me, asking me if I wanted to overwrite some of the files. Oops.

Everything seems to be working, though. Please leave a comment if you find something that is broken.

**UPDATE** I also updated the theme a bit, hope you like the new layout!
