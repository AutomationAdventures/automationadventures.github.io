On November 3rd, 2007, Sixth Floor Labs LLC announced that they launched their business. The press release can be found [here](http://www.sixthfloorlabs.com/posts/2007/11/05/Press_release/).

They also released the first release of [Project Alexandria](http://www.sixthfloorlabs.com/projects/alexandria/), an Asteroids-like arcade game. This is downloadable for free [here](http://www.sixthfloorlabs.com/projects/alexandria/download/).

Although it's commendable that a company decides to make Linux games, this game's graphics look very much like the Commodore 64 graphics. I haven't played the game yet, but I'm not sure the world is waiting for the next 1980's game. Hopefully future release will look a little better...
