Through [Michael Hyatt](http://www.michaelhyatt.com/fromwhereisit/)';s [blog](http://www.michaelhyatt.com/fromwhereisit/2007/11/how-not-to-use-.html), I came across [this talk](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/187) from Larry Lessig at TED about how the current copyright laws limit the creativity of people. Apart from the talk being absolutely informative, there are two great examples of creative work, that, according to today's copyright law, are not permitted:

Javier Prato's "Jesus Christ - The musical"

And George Bush and Tony Blair in a touching duet:

Hopefully law makers will develop the common sense Larry Lessig refers to.
