According to [MacNN](http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/12/03/itunes.movie.price.claim/), Apple is set to raise the prices on downloadable movies in iTunes to $15, just a couple of dollars below the retail price of a physical DVD. This means that for $3 more, you can order the same movie, without DRM, with extra content, in a nice box, and probably in better quality.

It is [suggested](http://macnn.com/rd/90912==http://www.electronista.com/articles/06/09/29/wal.mart.itunes.coupons/) in the article that the studios are under pressure from retailers such as Wal-Mart. Which basically means that old-style retail is trying to hold on to their distribution model, and forces the new-style retail to mimic their inefficiencies... I hope Apple will come up with something else, especially now that there are serious indications on the music side that the old model is failing (EMI [scaling back funding](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071128-report-emi-looking-to-slash-funding-for-riaa-ifpi.html) of the RIAA, [more](http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/25/amazon-launches-drm-free-amazon-mp3-music-downloads/) and [more](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/04/02itunes.html) DRM-free music).
