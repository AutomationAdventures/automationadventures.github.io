[Science Daily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/) has an [article](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080110161823.htm) describing how silicon nanowires can be used to capture body heat, and use that energy to power a wide array of devices. Some examples could be the Department of Energy’s hydrogen fuel cell-powered “Freedom CAR,” and personal power-jackets that could use heat from the human body to recharge cell-phones and other electronic devices.

<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0133093/trivia" target="_blank">Apparently</a> the human body generates over 25,000 BTUs in body heat, and more bioelectricity than a 120V battery. That should be enough to power a cell phone, and then some. Hopefully the machines won't find out how efficient we are at generating energy...
