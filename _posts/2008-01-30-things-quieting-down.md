Well, it's been very busy here the last couple of days. At home that is, the blog was kinda quiet. The hectic schedule from a couple of weeks ago has changed into taking care of a new baby.

Last Thursday, at 7:58AM, we became the proud parents of a little baby girl, named Diana. We got home from the hospital last Sunday, and are now trying to adjust to taking care of 7 pounds of little woman. Mother and daughter are doing fine, but they are demanding a lot of my time.

So, posting on the blog will be a little slow these days/weeks. Bear with me (that's what I tell my daughter too when I try to change her diaper, and so far, she has....).
