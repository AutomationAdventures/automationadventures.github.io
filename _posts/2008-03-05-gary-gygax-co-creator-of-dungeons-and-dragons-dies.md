I just read the excellent [Giant in the Playground](http://www.giantitp.com/) webcomic ["The Order of the Stick"](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html), and the [last installment](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0536.html) was a tribute to the late E. Gary Gygax. It [turns out](http://edition.cnn.com/2008/TECH/03/04/obit.gygax.ap/?imw=Y&iref=mpstoryemail) he died Tuesday March 4th in his home in Lake Geneva.

Some of you may recognize that name as one of the creators of Dungeons and Dragons, and Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. He provided hours of joy to countless geeks around the world.

Thanks for all the fun, Gary. You will be missed.
