[Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/) is presenting their [latest installment](http://arstechnica.com/guides/buyer/guide-200803.ars) of the Ars System Guide, discussing three setups for a DIY computer.

I'm still planning on building one, but with the <strike>new financial burden</strike> new baby, I'd have to go with the [budget box](http://arstechnica.com/guides/buyer/guide-200803.ars/2).

Ars Technica's Budget Box consists of the following components:

  * Asus M2A-VM HDMI motherboard
  * AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+ Retail (Socket AM2) processor
  * 2GB DDR2-800 RAM
  * PNY GeForce 9600GT video card
  * Western Digital Caviar SE16 320GB SATA hard disk
  * Samsung SH-S203B DVD/CD reader/writer
  * In-Win C589T case
  * Logitech X-240 speakers
  * HP w2007 20" LCD
  * Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer
  * Logitech Keyboard

  Sound and network are integrated on the motherboard. Total price as of March 23rd: $831.78.

  I used to think the budget systems were under $500, but I guess that's a different category (Poor Slob System?). Regardless, this system includes some components we may already have laying around. For example, most people have a monitor, keyboard and mouse they can use on their new system. Even the DVD/CD reader/writer may be usable. And how about a spare case?

  If I try to re-use an old hard disk, and start out with the on-board video (ATI Radeon X1250 chipset), I'd only have to buy the motherboard, RAM and CPU. Which means the breakdown becomes as follows:
</div>

  * Motherboard: $77.50
  * CPU: $64.99
  * RAM: $52.99
  * Total price: $195.48.

  Now that's respectable, and even allows me to add a hard disk and a DVD drive and still end up significantly under the $500. Time to start saving I guess!!
