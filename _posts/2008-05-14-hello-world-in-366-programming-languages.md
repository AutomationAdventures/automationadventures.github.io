I came across [this](http://www.roesler-ac.de/wolfram/hello.htm) interesting page, that shows the ubiquitous "Hello, World!" program in 366 different more or less well known programming languages.

It clearly shows the difference in the two database language that we use at my place of work, Cobol and Progress.

Cobol:

> * Hello World in Cobol
> 
> \***\***\***\***\***\***\***\***\*****  
> IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.  
> PROGRAM-ID. HELLO.  
> ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.  
> DATA DIVISION.  
> PROCEDURE DIVISION.  
> MAIN SECTION.  
> DISPLAY "Hello World!"  
> STOP RUN.  
> \***\***\***\***\***\***\***\***\****

Progress:

> /\* Hello World in Progress \*/
> 
> message "Hello World" view-as alert-box.

Check it out, there are some weird languages listed, like LOLCODE and Argh!
