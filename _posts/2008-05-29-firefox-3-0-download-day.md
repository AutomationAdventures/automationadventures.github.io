The Mozilla Foundation is trying to get into the Guinness Book of Records by setting a World Record for the most software downloaded in 24 hours. They plan on accomplishing this goal by having as many people as possible download Firefox 3.0 on the official launch date.

To participate, head over to Download Day 2008, and either monitor the site to see when the update day arrives, or pledge to download and be informed by e-mail when the big day arrives. As of this moment, over 66,000 people have pledge to participate, with about 12,000 coming from the U.S.
