<a href="http://www.spore.com/" target="_blank">Spore</a> is making progress! The <a href="http://www.spore.com/what/platforms#platformscreaturecreator" target="_blank">Creature Creator</a> that was announced for June 17th (yeah, good timing with Firefox Download Day!), is now available! Check out the demo [here](http://tinyurl.com/5rz43j)!

The Creature Creator will be used to have people design different creatures, which will be used to populate the game universe for the full Spore game when it ships this September.

The demo version has 25% of the total body parts, the full retail version is supposed to make all body parts available.
