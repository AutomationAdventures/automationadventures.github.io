It has happened to everyone: you are composing this message, and say something like "as you can see in the attached Excel sheet" or talk about the cute picture you've attached, and then you forget to attach the file...

Have no fear, <a href="http://mark.bird.googlepages.com/home" target="_blank">Outlook Attachment Reminder</a> is here! A small but effective script will scan your message for the word "attach", and check to see if you indeed have attached any files. If not, it will alert you, and ask you if you want to send it anyway.

If you have a signature that uses files, the script even has a provision for that!
