I just finished watching a recording of Merlin Mann's presentation _Bear traps, time burglars and attention sinks, or "Why does my email make me crazy?"_. He discusses the problems today's Knowledge Worker faces, and gives a couple of quick tips on how to get a handle on them.

You can watch the recording at [iTunes](http://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse/new.duke.edu.1292103951?i=1578970815). Also, visit Merlin's website [43folders](http://www.43folders.com/) for more information and tips on Getting Things Done.
