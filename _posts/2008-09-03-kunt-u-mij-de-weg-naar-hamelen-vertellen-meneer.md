Now, this is what the Internet is all about in my opinion.

This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunt_u_mij_de_weg_naar_Hamelen_vertellen,_mijnheer%3F" target="_blank">Dutch children TV show</a>, from the early 1970's if I remember correctly, about what happened to the children of the village of Hamelen, or Hamelin as you English speakers might know it, when the Pied Piper (or "Rattenvanger") frees the town of rats, but keeps the children hostage until the village pays him.

Popular believe has it that only 6 episodes survived on tape. However, someone only known as ogterop-deux (after one of the characters the kids encounter) is trying to get other episodes online. Check out <a href="http://ogterop-deux.blip.tv/file/932672/" target="_blank">this</a> compilation of the first season, and follow the links to see other episodes.

A warning however: since this show is Dutch, it is spoken in Dutch, so only of interest to people who actually speak Dutch... ðŸ™‚
