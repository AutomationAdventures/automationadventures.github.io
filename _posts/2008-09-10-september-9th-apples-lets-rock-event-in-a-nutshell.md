Yesterday <a href="http://apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a> had its <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/letsrock/" target="_blank">September presentation</a>, which, as the title "Let's Rock" may have given away, was focused on iTunes and the various iPod models. Here are the announcements in a nutshell:

  * HD TV shows added to the iTunes store. $2.99 per episode ($1.99 for standard definition), and you can view them on Apple TV and your computer (and hopefully you iPod).
  * NBC returns to the iTunes store.
  * <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/" target="_blank">iTunes 8</a> is announced:
  * New browsing options
  * Genius mode: automatic playlist based on songs that "go great together". It sounds like Pandora in iTunes.

  * <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodclassic/" target="_blank">iPod classic</a>: the current line up of an 80GB and a 160GB model will be changed to one 120GB model, priced at $250 (what, not $249?).
  * <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/" target="_blank">iPod Nano</a> 4G:
  * has the form factor of the Nano 2G
  * the video of the 3G
  * Built-in accelerometer
  * new User Interface
  * landscape mode for coverflow
  * thinnest Nano yet
  * $149 for 8GB, $199 for 16GB

  * <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/" target="_blank">iPod Touch</a>:
  * Thinner
  * has integrated volume control
  * built-in speaker(!)
  * Genius playlist creation
  * Nike+ built-in (you still need the Nike+ transmitter)
  * $229 for 8GB, $299 for 16GB, and $399 for 32GB

  * AppStore: 100 million downloads in the first 60 days. Upcoming offerings: Spore Origins, Real Soccer 2009, Need for Speed: Undercover.
  * Two new headphones:
  * A <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB770G/A?fnode=MTY1NDA0Ng&mco=MTcyOTAyNg&p=1&s=topSellers" target="_blank">regular set</a> with in-band control (volume, next, prev, play, pause) and microphone for $29
  * An <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/inearheadphones/" target="_blank">in-ear set</a> with two drivers per bud (woofer and tweeter) for $79

  * iPod Touch 2.1 software: Free upgrade for 2.0 users, $9.95 for 1.x users
  * iPhone 2.1 software:
  * Free upgrade
  * improved battery life
  * fewer call drops
  * fewer crashes
  * increased speed for iTunes backups

  It sounds that Apple is slowly retiring the iPod classic, and adding more emphasis on the AppStore. More news can be read at <a href="http://gizmodo.com/tag/appleletsrock" target="_blank">Gizmodo</a> and other sites around the net.
