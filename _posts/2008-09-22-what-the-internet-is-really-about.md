A couple of weeks ago I said that I thought that I knew <a href="/2008/09/kunt-u-mij-de-weg-naar-hamelen-vertellen-meneer.html" target="_blank">what the Internet was all about</a>.

I was wrong.

The Internet is about sharing information, without censorship, or control, from government, police, any official, religious or political leader. It is up to you to decide what is the truth. Don't get all your information from one source, that is tightly controlled (i.e. TV). Gather your news like they are precious nuggets of gold.

The reason I bring this up is this documentary:

[![Zero: An investigation into 9-11-2001](http://img.youtube.com/vi/O-YqET96OO0/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-YqET96OO0)

It is a long documentary, but worthwhile the information. If nothing else, it will wake up the gray cells in your head!
