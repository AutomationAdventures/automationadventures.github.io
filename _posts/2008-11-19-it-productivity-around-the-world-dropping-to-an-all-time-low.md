Productivity in IT departments around the world, and even in some other departments, dropped to an all-time low, when news got out that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/MontyPython" target="_blank">Monty Python created an official YouTube channel</a>. The commitment of the Pythons is to publish their videos in high quality.

It is hard to say whether departments will recover from this shock.
