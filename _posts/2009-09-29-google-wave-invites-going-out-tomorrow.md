Google Wave invites are slated to be sent out tomorrow to more than 100,000 people. As stated in their <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/surfs-up-wednesday-google-wave-update.html" target="_blank">blog</a>, these invites will go out to developers, users who have signed up and offered to give feedback, and select customers of Google Apps. Some of these invitees will be able to invite other people.

The blog post stresses that this is a beta test, and several features will still be missing from it. Also, the occasional downtime is to be expected.

Be that as it may, I'm hoping I can open my Inbox tomorrow and see a Wave invite. I think Google Wave may be like GMail: despite all the quirks and problems in the beginning, in a couple of years people will panic if it's down for an hour. Now, how do I set it up to be integrated with my blog...?
