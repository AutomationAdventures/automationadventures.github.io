This looks like a cop-out, but here is how you do it:  
<a name='more'></a>[wave id="googlewave.com!w+9wEkpHp-B" bgcolor="#000000" font="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" font_size="11" width="500" height="700"]

Oh, and you need the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wavr/" target="_blank">Wavr </a>plugin.

P.S. If you don't see anything, you probably don't have a Google Wave account. Which would make embedding a wave in your blog... ehm... difficult.
