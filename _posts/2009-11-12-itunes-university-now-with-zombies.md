I've been hearing great things about the iTunes University, sporting audio and video from large Universities and Open Course material. Today I decided to check it out.

Apart from all the material on running your business, introductions to physics and biology etc., there are some truly interesting lectures. One that caught my eye was the University of Alabama's <a href="http://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse/bama.ua.edu.2584086121" target="_blank">"Zombies! Intro to Zombie Studies"</a>. With episode titles as "She's not your Mother anymore" and "The Living as Minority" this sounds like a winner.

I'm afraid though that the real title of the lecture is "Zombies! The Living Dead in Literature", so this may be not as useful as I hoped in the event of a <a href="http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/HowTo:Survive_the_Impending_Zombie_Invasion" target="_blank">zombie invasion</a>...
