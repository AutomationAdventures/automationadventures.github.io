It looks like the Mozilla Labs <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10868" target="_blank">Weave </a>add-on is getting close to a 1.0 version, with Monday's release of the <a href="https://services.mozilla.com/updated/changelog.html" target="_blank">1.0 beta 1</a>.

Weave is an add-on that can synchronize your bookmarks, history, saved passwords and tabs between multiple machines. It stores all this information encrypted on a Mozilla-run server, but you can also set up your own Weave server to store all the info.

The 1.0 release has a change in the database and API, so if you are using Weave, make sure you upgrade all the machines using it. If you're running your own server, you need to upgrade it too (minor change in the Apache configuration).
