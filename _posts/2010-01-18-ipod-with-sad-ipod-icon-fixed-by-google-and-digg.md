![Apple iPod sad](/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sad-ipod.gif)

Last Saturday my iPod froze up. After applying the reset (Hold on, Hold off, press and hold Menu and Select at the same time), the screen displayed the Sad iPod Icon. Fearing my podcast and audio book listening days were not over but put on indefinite hiatus, I drove home and entered the URL the iPod displayed: <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/ipod/" target="_blank">http://www.apple.com/support/ipod</a>. 

The results there were <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1373?viewlocale=en_US" target="_blank">less</a> than <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/ipod/five_rs/" target="_blank">encouraging</a>: try and reconnect your iPod to the computer (sorry, problem didn't occur while connecting to the computer), or send it in for repairs. Well, we're talking an almost 4 year old iPod here, so any repairs would probably cost more than the iPod is worth (heck the shipping cost is probably more than it's worth...!). So I decided to use Google to see if anyone had an alternative solution.

This leads me to a <a href="http://digg.com/apple/How_To_Fix_an_Ipod_with_the_Sad_iPod_Icon" target="_blank">Digg article</a>, that pointed to an article "<a href="http://www.spillingcoffee.com/2006/07/13/how-to-fix-an-ipod-with-the-sad-ipod-icon/" target="_blank">How To Fix an Ipod with the Sad iPod Icon</a>" on Spilling Coffee. The basic solution boils down to:

  1. Put something on your desk (a stack of paper works great) to prevent your desk from getting damaged (don't worry about the iPod)
  2. Grab the iPod firmly, with the connector pointing down
  3. Slam it on the stack of papers on your desk

The idea is that the hard disk connector can come lose enough not to make connection anymore, but still be attached enough that a good bang will snap it back into place.

So with a heavy heart and closed eyes I banged my iPod on the desk and performed another reset. Lo and behold, the menu appeared! And faster than it had done on previous resets!! Thanks Tom Coffee!

Warning: banging your iPod on your desk may cause damage to desk, iPod, or anything else in the vicinity. It worked for me, but it may not work for you. Banging your iPod is a serious form of Apple fan-dom...
