I just entered a search query for Notepad++ in Google Chrome, and the results page looked slightly different from what I'm used to:

![Google Search results](/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/GoogleSearch.png)

![Google Search Tools](/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/GoogleSearchTools.png)

Most notably, the left hand side is much cleaner. Clicking on the drop-down below "Everything" will show you the different categories (Images, Videos, etc.). The Search tools option lets you choose between "Any Time" and "Last 3 months", and expanding it will show you a new list of options:

  * Limit to a time period
  * Social graph results
  * Visited or not
  * Display of results
  * Standard results

  I'm still trying to get used to it, but it looks like the result page is in line with Google's minimalistic philosophy.
