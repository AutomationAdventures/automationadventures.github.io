Zedomax blog has a <a href="http://zedomax.com/blog/2010/05/04/android-multi-touch-tablet-prototype-hands-on-review-web-2-0-expo/" target="_blank">preview</a> of an Android tablet running Android at the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/" rel="homepage" title="Adobe Systems">Adobe</a> exhibit at Web 2.0. Although the preview shows off a lot of the functions (including the ability to run <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/" rel="homepage" title="Adobe Flash">Flash</a> and Air applications on the tablet), there are two distinct disadvantages for an Android/Flash tablet:

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The number of apps available for Android versus the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/" rel="homepage" title="iPad">iPad</a><br />Currently <a href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="homepage" title="Apple">Apple</a> has more than 180,000 apps, versus Android about 50,000 apps. I hate to quote Balmer, but "Developers! Developers! Developers!". If I have a platform where the 1 millionth device just shipped, versus a new platform, I'd go with the 1 million device user base.
    </li>
    <li>
      The different user interface a (touch) tablet requires versus a mouse drive app.<br />Examples of this are hover functions, double-click, etc., which have to be redesigned for a touch interface.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <div>
    One of the big advantages would be the ability to put an app on an Android tablet without having to go through a vetting process at Apple that is less than transparent. Also, chances are the device will be cheaper, based on <a href="http://google.com/" rel="homepage" title="Google">Google</a>';s philosophy that the more people use the web, the better it is for Google.
  </div>

  <div>
    I guess we'll have to wait until the end of the year to see what the Android tablet will look like, how much it will cost, and how it will perform.
