The other day I was talking to a co-worker (non-programmer), and she mentioned that she just finds it unbelievable how programmers write their programs. I likened programs to recipes, and referred to Short Circuit, where Johnny 5 burns a frozen meal because the instructions didn't specify that the meal should be taken out of the box...

While recipes are a good analogy, for people who like the analogy a bit more specific to programming (and still have fun), here are some good resources:

  * [Lightbot](http://www.kongregate.com/games/Coolio_Niato/light-bot?sfa=permalink&referrer=RonaldB), a neat little robot game that uses instructions to light squares.
  * [Lightbot 2.0](http://www.kongregate.com/games/Coolio_Niato/lighbot-2-0?sfa=permalink&referrer=RonaldB), the sequel to Lightbot.
  * [Robot Battle](http://www.robotbattle.com/), a game about building a robot and competing against others in an arena.
  * [Logo](http://www.calormen.com/Logo/), the original educational programming language
  * [Alice](http://www.alice.org/), a 3D programming environment tutorial.

  Learning to program should be fun, and I hope these resources help you out.
