Through [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/) I came across [this awesome presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Sharpening-the-Tools) by [Dan North](http://blog.dannorth.net/) about how to progress from beginner to expert, and how that cycle continues (even after reaching expert level).

Just a couple of tools I'd never heard about:

  * **Hudson** - A continuous integration tool, for Java projects, that allows easy integration of changes into a project, and easy retrieval of a fresh build.
  * **GROW Framework** - A coaching/self-help tool. GROW stands for **G**oal, current **R**eality, **O**ptions, and **W**ill. In a nutshell, it lets you evaluate what you want to do, how you want to do it, and apply yourself to doing it.
  * **Six Thinking Hats** - A thinking tool for group discussions and individual thinking.
  * **Clojure** - A strange mix between Java and Lisp..?
  * **Open Spaces** - A meeting/discussion technique to discuss various topics, in a sort-of ad-hoc conference way. Open Spaces last from half a day to about 2 days.
  * **Ivy** - The Agile Dependency Manager (and that's all I have for now).

  So it looks like I've got a nice list of things to learn about, on top of trying to learn more about HTML5, JavaScript, C#, Sharepoint, Visual Web Developer, and MS-SQL...
