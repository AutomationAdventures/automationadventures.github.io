As you may have noticed, we've completely redone our layout.

The previous template had some serious issues with some of the widgets we were using on this site. Wave plugins would flow over into other posts, and recently our ads started floating into places they shouldn't. There were some other minor annoyances, but the fact that elements of the website started showing up where they didn't belong, was the last straw...

The current theme is based on the [Genesis framework](http://www.studiopress.com/themes/genesis), and allows for a lot of flexibility in the layout. We're still working on the various parts we want to show on the homepage and the articles, and the colors of the site don't completely match those of the plugins, but we're working hard on getting all of it done by this weekend.

Let me know what you think of the new theme, and if you encounter any problems, don't hesitate to <a href="/p/contact-us.html" target="_self">contact us</a>.

Enjoy the site!
