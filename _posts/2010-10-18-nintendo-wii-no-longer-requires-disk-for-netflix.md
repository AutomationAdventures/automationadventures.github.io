Netflix has been available for a couple of months on the Nintendo Wii, but up until now you needed to insert a disk to browse the list of movies and play one.  
In today's [press release](http://press.nintendo.com/articles.jsp?id=25904), Nintendo announces that it is now possible to install a Netflix channel in their Wii Menu. The new Netflix channel is free of charge, but requires a Netflix subscription of $8.99 or higher ($7.99 in Canada).  
This change will greatly enhance the usability of the Wii as a Netflix appliance. All we have to do now is turn on the Wii and go to the Netflix channel, instead of making sure the right disk is loaded. Kudos to Nintendo and Netflix for making this possible!
