So, how did I do for the event? Let's revisit the predictions: 

<table border="2" bordercolor="#008DCF">
  <tr>
    <th>
      Rumor
    </th>
    
    <th>
      Result
    </th>
    
    <th>
      Remarks
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      Mac OS X 10.7 "Lion"
    </th>
    
    <td>
      🙂
    </td>
    
    <td>
      And a nice upgrade. Several things from the mobile (iOS) platform rolled into OS X.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      Updated versions of iWork and iLife
    </th>
    
    <td>
      🙂
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Yay. Love the photo and movie editing and publishing capabilities. GarageBand has now stooped to the level of "any idiot can make music".
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      A smaller version of the MacBook Air
    </th>
    
    <td>
      🙂
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Smaller, but also the old 13". And improved battery life!
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      Facetime on Mac
    </th>
    
    <td>
      🙂
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Can't wait for integration with the PC!
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      iPhone on the Verizon network
    </th>
    
    <td>
      🙁
    </td>
    
    <td>
      They'll have another event for that.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      The iMac Touch is announced
    </th>
    
    <td>
      😐
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Well, sort of: Apple explained why they don't think a touchscreen desktop is a good idea, and showed us the alternative.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      Apple buys Facebook
    </th>
    
    <td>
      🙁
    </td>
    
    <td>
      They may have another event for that...
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

All in all, 4 1/2 out of 7. Not a bad score I think, considering the craziness of some of the rumors.
