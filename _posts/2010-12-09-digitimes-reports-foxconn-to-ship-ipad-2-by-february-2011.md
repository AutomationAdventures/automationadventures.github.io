One thing to put on your right-after-christmas wishlist: the iPad 2. Foxconn is rumored to have been notified they will ship Apple's iPad 2 within 100 days - i.e. by the end of February 2011. Initial shipments should be reaching 400,000-600,000 units.

The iPad 2 will probably sport a front-facing camera to allow FaceTime and other video applications, an improved display copying the Retina Display of the iPhone and iPod, and a lighter body offering better mobility. If Foxconn will indeed start shipping iPad 2's by February, the official launch will most likely be by April 2011.
