This Saturday December the 11th <a href="http://www.ltzllc.com/" target="_blank">LTZ</a> organizes an <a href="http://www.ltzllc.com/2010/11/ios-development-code-kitchen/" target="_blank">iOS Development Code Kitchen</a>, hosted by one of LTZ's chief developers, <a href="http://www.mikeziray.com/" target="_blank">Mike Ziray</a>. The code kitchen will be held on the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg, and is free of charge!

Join them in a day-long, hands-on iOS experience. Unfortunately I can't make it this weekend (we have major maintenance scheduled on our database environment), but I'm looking forward to the next code kitchen.
