Just in time for the holidays, and getting close to the cut-off date for even electronic greeting cards to arrive in time for Christmas, Google present the <a href="http://www.teachparentstech.org/" target="_blank">"Teach Parents Tech" Care Package site</a>.

This site allows anyone to create a greeting card with a number of instructional videos (provided by Google) on a range of different topics, from changing your background on Mac or PC to setting up video chat and sharing photos online. The resulting email is a little bland and not as exciting as the promo on the GMail login page shows, but I think it does the trick.

The only video that's missing is how to check your email and play videos... I guess a little in-person help may be necessary for some parents.. ðŸ™‚

**UPDATE**: [Here's the link](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/12/teachparentstechorg-keeping-tech.html) to the original Google Blog article. I guess I'm a little late to the party.
