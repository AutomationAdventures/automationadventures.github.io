<a href="http://wave.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Wave</a> is scheduled to be closed at the end of this month. Luckily, there is a <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/12/google-shared-spaces.html" target="_blank">place to go for all the gadgets</a> that were written for Wave - and it's not gadget hell, but <a href="http://sharedspaces.googlelabs.com/" target="_blank">Shared Spaces</a>.

Shared Spaces is a Google Labs product, and instead of centering around the conversation like Google Wave, Shared Spaces is more centered around a particular gadget. You can create a space around a map to collaboratively plan a trip, or around a mind map gadget to brainstorm about an idea.

The slideshow below shows a little about Google's idea of a shared space:

It looks like Shared Space uses Google Buzz in the background. I'm also not sure if it's possible to make Shared Spaces invite-only, or that anyone who guesses the URL can participate. I'll let you know more once I've played a little more with it.
