<a href="http://www.theopeninter.net/" target="_blank">TheOpenInter.Net</a> has a quick overview of what Net Neutrality is, and why it is important to you, and to the future use of the Internet. The site is completely done in HTML5, so even iPads can view it without too much problems.

It quickly and simply describes what the current state of the Internet is, what Big ISPs want (bundle services like they are TV channels, charging separately for certain content), and why it is important that they don't succeed. If a friend of yours has problems understanding what Net Neutrality is, send them there.
