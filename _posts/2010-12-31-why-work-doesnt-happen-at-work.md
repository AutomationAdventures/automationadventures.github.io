Jason Fried of [37Signals](http://37signals.com/) presented a talk at [Ted](http://www.blogger.com/www.ted.com) this October, explaining why so little work is actually done at work:

[![TedTalks Why work doesn't happen at work](http://img.youtube.com/vi/5XD2kNopsUs/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XD2kNopsUs)

A few Take-aways:

  * Cancel meetings - and see if work still gets done
  * Institute a No-Talk Thursday - nobody can talk to each other
  * Rely more on IM, email, and other non-interactive means to communicate to each other

This may be a good time to plug a 37Signals product called [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/). It enables co-workers to be available for chat, but not miss anything when they're not in the chat. It's also a better solution than IM, since it allows easily for 3- or 4-way chats. Last but not least, you don't need to install every IM client in the world to be available - all you need is a browser.
