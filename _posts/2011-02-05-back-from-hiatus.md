So, 2 weeks ago was the last post, ironically enough introducing a new, weekly feature.

And then life happened.

We got into a February 1st deadline at work, which resulted in long hours, only to be interrupted by both my wife and myself struck by the stomach flu that seems to be going around in these parts. Which in turn meant that there was precious little time to write on the blog.

So be it.

But we're back in full force, and I've got some interesting stuff to tell you. One of the news items involves the way I'm writing this blog post - no, not going to tell you, just wait for the next post.

So keep reading and I promise there will be a weekly feature, and more.

Cheers!
