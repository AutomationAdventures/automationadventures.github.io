Two days ago a non-descript package arrived. Opening up the package very carefully, I found a big, rectangular cardboard box inside, with on it something that looked like an assembly drawing of a mouse trap.

After putting on my Hazmat suit, and telling wife and kid to evacuate the building, I carefully opened it. Inside was a black slab, about 12 by 9 inches inside. At that point I heard "Also Sprach Zarathustra" in the back of my mind. Luckily it wasn't a [monolith](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/), but one of [Google's CR48 netbooks](http://www.google.com/chromeos/pilot-program-cr48.html).

So far I've been able to charge the battery, take my profile picture, log into our corporate and home networks, and probably screw up the built-in 3G wireless account...

I haven't run into any major problems yet, apart from the fact that my beloved [NotScripts](http://www.automationadventures.blogspot.com/2010/08/notscripts-noscript-option-for-chrome.html) uses a setting in a file on the file system, that is not accessible - all you get with the Chrome OS is a browser windows. But I'll let you all share in the experience of Living in the Cloud.

Oh, and I apologize for the picture quality - I only had my cellphone available, and the carpet didn't make for the best background...
