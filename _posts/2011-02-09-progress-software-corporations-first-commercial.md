As you may know, I do a lot of development in [Progress OpenEdge](http://web.progress.com/en/openedge/index.html) 10, which used to be called Progress 4GL, which has been around for a few decades now. Here's one of their first, if not \_the\_ first, commercial, from when the company was still called [Data Language Corporation](http://web.progress.com/en/whoweare/history.html). 80's style!
