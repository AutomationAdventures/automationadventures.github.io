This week's Game of the Week is <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/Andromedus/mooo" target="_blank">Mooo!</a> from <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/accounts/Andromedus" target="_blank">Andromedus</a>, a puzzle game where you have to move the cow to the milk bottle (or vice versa in some cases) to fill the bottle with milk. It's in essence a physics puzzle game, where hay bails, wooden poles and bombs all work together to get the cow to the bottle, or to keep them apart.

The game is 20 predefined levels, and includes a level editor to create your own puzzles.
