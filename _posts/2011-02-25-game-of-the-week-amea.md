This week's Flash game is [Amea](http://www.kongregate.com/games/godlimations/amea) by [Godlimitations](http://www.godlimations.com/).

Amea takes you on a journey of remembrance. You play a girl who has lost her memory, and wakes up in a small town that is overrun by monsters. She hears a voice and follows it to find herself in a forest, that is even more overrun. Gradually the characters she runs into make her remember more and more of the past.

The game itself has a good atmosphere, and the choices you make early on can affect you in the later stages. However, if you do chose the wrong spells in the beginning, as long as you find all the runes, you can power level yourself up at the end to defeat the final monster. In all, A+ for the atmosphere and the graphics, but the music can be a little overwhelming, as is the sound Amea makes when she gets hit. Definitely worth playing.
