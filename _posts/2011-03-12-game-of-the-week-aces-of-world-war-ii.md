This week's game has become a serious time sink for me. I've always loved aerial combat, and <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/Genimo/aces-of-world-war-ii" target="_blank">Aces of World War II</a> is a good multi-player implementation.

Technically, this is not a Flash based game. It uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)" target="_blank">Unity web player</a> to allow for the quick-responding real-time graphics. But that's just a minor detail...

The game play itself can be infuriating at times. You start out with a fairly powerless plane, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloster_Gladiator#Variants" target="_blank">Gladiator Mk. II</a>. It takes over 700 Action Points to get to the next plane - and Action Points are awarded when you shoot down another plane. Your best bet is to get rockets as soon as possible - these are 100 APs, and last for a full day. With a bit of luck and skill, you'll be able to shoot down a couple of enemies a day and eventually get the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TBD_Devastator" target="_blank">TBD Devastator</a> - much more powerful, and very agile.

But before you dive into Dogfights, prepare yourself with some training missions. In the training, remember that rear-mounted guns have a hard time shooting under the plane it's mounted in. And when you feel comfortable, go ahead and join the Dogfights. Just pay attention to what kind of scenario it is - in Team Dogfights, you can shoot down your team mates, but it doesn't earn you points, and might piss them off...

There is a total of 44 planes available in the game, ranging from the Gladiator to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-51_Mustang" target="_blank">P-51 Mustang</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J7W_Shinden" target="_blank">J7W1 Shinden</a>. The only weapons upgrade available now is the rockets, but more is listed as coming soon, as are upgrades and stunts.

Good luck, happy hunting and Tally ho!
