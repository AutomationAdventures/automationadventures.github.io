Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/ultra-high-speed-broadband-is-coming-to.html" target="_blank">announced</a> today that they have selected Kansas City, Kansas, for their ultra high-speed broadband project.

The <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/think-big-with-gig-our-experimental.html" target="_blank">ultra high-speed broadband project</a> aims to deliver 1 Gigabit/s internet speeds to its users. Kansas City was selected because Google found here "a location where we could build efficiently, make an impact on the community and develop relationships with local government and community organizations."

Google plans to start delivering the ultra high-speed access beginning 2012.
