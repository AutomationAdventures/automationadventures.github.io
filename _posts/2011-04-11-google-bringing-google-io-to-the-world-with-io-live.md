Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/04/bringing-google-io-direct-to-you-with.html" target="_blank">announced</a> Thursday that they will be bringing Google I/O to the web, naming it I/O Live.

After the tickets to <a href="http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/" target="_blank">Google I/O</a> sold out in under an hour, Google decided to do the same thing several other companies (notably Progress with their Exchange conference) and bring the presentations to the web. They will be streaming live video from the two largest conference rooms, capturing the keynotes, but also session from Android and Chrome. There will be real-time captions of the live streams courtesy of Google Translate. And last but not least, you can submit questions directly to the sandbox developers.

Google I/O 2011 starts at 9AM PDT on May 10th.
