While I'm enjoying my Cr-48, it has a few drawbacks. One of the drawbacks is that you can't install any programs on it, other than Chrome extensions and apps. This is a big hurdle towards reading eBooks on the device - Amazon's Kindle requires an application to be installed on the device, whether it's a PC, Mac, or mobile platform.

Luckily Google saw this too, and came up with [Google eBooks](http://books.google.com/help/ebooks/overview.html). As most of Google's products, this is completely web-based. And as thus, it's easy to see how they can provide a seamless reading experience between different devices: you can read a book on your PC, then continue exactly where you left off on your smart phone.

The selection of books is pretty broad. Google eBooks touts 3 million selections. And not just Computers & Internet, but also Mystery, Romance, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, etc.
