OK, so we [announced]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2011-03-18-duke-nukem-forever-finally %}) about 3 weeks ago that Duke Nukem Forever was really coming out. Now it turns out it is delayed until June 14th, 2011.

I hope this is not setting a precedent. Oh wait, never mind...

[Pre-order](https://http://www.dukenukemforever.com/preorder/) is still available. And I still am not going to do it!
