[Hands of War II](https://www.notdoppler.com/handsofwar2.php) is an adventure game, taking place in the land of Tempor. Tempor is torn by a civil war between the Phoenix and the Guardians. The Phoenix want to use a powerful magic stone to exact revenge on the surrounding lands that invaded Tempor, and the Guardians want to prevent more bloodshed.

On top of that, there is fierce rivalry between the three guilds, the Rangers, the Wizards, and the Warriors. So, there is enough room for some serious combat. The player needs to choose which Guild and which Faction he joins, and is then issued quests to fulfill.

A nicely done game, and since I've always had a soft spot for adventures, Hands of War is our game of the week.
