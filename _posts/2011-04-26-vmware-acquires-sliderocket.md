Today, <a href="http://www.sliderocket.com/" target="_blank">SlideRocket</a> <a href="http://www.sliderocket.com/launch/vmware_sliderocket.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that they have been acquired by VMWare.

SlideRocket is an online presentation tool, that tries to put a new twist on the age-old and most of the time boring PowerPoint presentation. With SlideRocket, you can easily integrate audio, rich media, and instant feedback to bring a presentation to life.

VMWare is an industry-leading virtualization platform, that has a range of products covering anything from simple workstation to multi-core, multi-disk top-of-the-line server array.

By the sound of the <a href="http://www.sliderocket.com/about/pr_2011-04-26.html" target="_blank">press release</a>, it seems to me that VMWare is trying to expand themselves past their core business of virtualization, and get more into cloud computing. Previous steps in that direction include <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/view/" target="_blank">VMWare View</a>, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/thinapp/overview.html" target="_blank">ThinApp</a> and <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/" target="_blank">Zimbra</a>. Hopefully, the estimated 20,000 users of SlideRocket will continue to be serviced by this pretty awesome presentation tool.
