This week's Game of the Week is a nifty little acrobatics game called <a href="http://www.notdoppler.com/stuntpilot.php" target="_blank">Stuntpilot</a>.

You're piloting a stunt plane, that flies through a series of rings. Touch a ring, and you have to bail out of the plane. Each level gets progressively more difficult, with hot air balloons, zeppelins, towers on the ground and more difficult placement of the rings.

A sometimes frustrating game, but fun to spend a couple of hours on.
