This week an older game, that used to be an install. Now it's available in Google Chrome: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aknpkdffaafgjchaibgeefbgmgeghloj" target="_blank">Angry Birds</a>.

Rovio stated in the keynote on Google I/O 2011 that when the Webstore would be fully operational, they would make the Mighty Eagle available as well.

I guess that's all I need to say about that.

Oh! One more thing: there are several Chrome levels built into the Chrome version.

Have fun!!!
