This week's game came to my attention because a version of this (older) game was released for the iPad.

<a href="http://www.gamenode.com/puzzle-word-games/paper-train/" target="_blank">Paper Train</a> is a combination of puzzle and reaction game, in which you control sets of trains being unleashed on a railroad track drawn on paper. You control the trains by switches and signals, and in some cases there are trains you can't control at all.

A nail-biting game (will this train pass in front of the other or get hit), that is addictive in it's "one more try" principle.
