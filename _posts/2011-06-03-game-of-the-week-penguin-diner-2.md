This week's game is [Penguin Diner 2](http://www.kongregate.com/games/Weboh/penguin-diner-2), a (by the author admitted) rip-off of [Diner Dash](http://www.playfirst.com/game/dinerdash), and a sequel to [Penguin Diner](http://www.2dplay.com/penguin-diner/penguin-diner-play.htm).

It puts you in the shoes (or skates as you will) of Penny, a penguin waitress, who has finally returned home to create the perfect diner. And this involves adding tables, comfy chairs, decorations, speed skates, top chefs, and themes to the diners in various regions of the South Pole.

A funny game, very reminiscent of Diner Dash, but the way the penguin guests attract your attention is the best: a friendly "Helloooo". Good for a couple of hours of quick reaction fun.
