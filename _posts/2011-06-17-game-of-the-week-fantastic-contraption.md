This week's GotW is [Fantastic Contraption](http://www.notdoppler.com/fantasticcontraption.php), a puzzle game where the goal is to get a pink ball into the pink area.

You have a work shop area, where you build the contraption to move the pink ball to the target area. When you press the Start button, your contraption takes off and moves by itself (hopefully) into the direction of the target (hopefully).

There are several different levels of difficulty, and the full version ($10) gives you access to more user-generated levels and the ability to generate your own levels.
