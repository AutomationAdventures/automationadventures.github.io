This week's GotW is specific to the Chrome browser, although there are versions of this game for other platforms (iPod/iPhone).

[The Secret of Grisly Manor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kpaadcbfeeiehmjlfbgpafdjbeikhgff) by [Fire Maple Games](http://www.firemaplegames.com/) is a point-and-click adventure. Your Grandfather is reported as dead, but then you arrive a letter from him telling you that the news of his death is not true. You need to go to Grisly Manor, and solve the riddles he left behind to find out the truth.

The game mechanics are pretty straight forward. Unlike some of the other point-and-click adventures I've played, there are no tiny spots you have to click on (most likely an inheritance from the iPod/iPhone interface). Each puzzle leads to another, giving you the ingredients needed to solve them.

The graphics are pretty good, and combined with the background music and sound effects give the right atmosphere to the game. If you get stuck, you can Google for the name of the game and find a few walk-throughs.
