I've had this tool laying around in my to-do folder for a while now, and today seemed like a good day to take a look at it.

Office Tab brings the tabbed interface from IE, Firefox and Chrome to the Office suite. Instead of the user interface where each document is a separate window, you're basically returning to the old interface from I think Office XP, where each application within the suite has one window, and there are multiple documents within that window.

The [Free version](http://www.extendoffice.com/download/office-tab-free-edition.html) allows you to include tabs in Word, Excel and PowerPoint. If you want tabs in Project or Visio, you'll need the Professional or Enterprise version. A complete comparison of the versions is found [here](http://www.extendoffice.com/product/office-tab.html).

Office Tab 7 is available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions, and supports Office 2003, 2007 and 2010.
