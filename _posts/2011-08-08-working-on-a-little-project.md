Hey guys, just wanted to let you know I'm still alive and hard at work...

I was planning on putting out some posts on how I integrated Request Tracker with Flow.io, but it takes a little longer than expected (my Perl knowledge is growing by the day though). It seems to work now, so keep your eyes on the blog, and I'll post something next week or so.

Meanwhile, enjoy summer!
