Google has just released a set of [Chromebook videos](http://www.google.com/chromebook/features-videos.html), just in time for the holiday season. The purpose of these videos is to show how easy a Chromebook is in set up, use and maintenance. I experienced the ease of maintenance this morning, while during a meeting I:

  1. received a notification that a new ChromeOS version was available


  2. applied the update, which requires rebooting the machine.


  3. was back in business after about 15 seconds.

[Consider a Chromebook](http://www.google.com/chromebook/#buynow) for your family members, who do very little besides surfing the web. I heard Chromebooks work great with Facebook...:-)
