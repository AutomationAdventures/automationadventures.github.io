We are supporting the January 18th [blackout in protest against the SOPA and PIPA acts](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all.html). On January 18th, from 8AM to 8PM, our site will be replaced by a banner not unlike the one displayed when our site would be subject to a violation as described in the SOPA and PIPA acts.

We believe both the SOPA and PIPA acts are violating the First and Fourth Amendments. On top of that, the provisions in the acts do nothing to prevent malicious websites from distributing the copyrighted software, but affect benevolent sites by way of collateral damage. And finally, the provisions describe ways to try and break the internet structure.

For further information, see the following links:

  * <http://americancensorship.org/>

Normal operations will resume January 18th, 8PM.

**Update**: we changed plugins at the last minute, since the original plugin would not allow any access to the site at all...
