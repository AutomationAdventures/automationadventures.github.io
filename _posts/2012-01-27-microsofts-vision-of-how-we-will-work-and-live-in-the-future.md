Microsoft is working on its view of the future. This is a video of how [Microsoft envisions Office](http://www.microsoft.com/office/vision/) in the (near?) future, and how it impacts our work and home live. Pay close attention to the recipe the girl selects at the end - it shows the ingredients being displayed on the kitchen counter. What it leaves out is something I've seen in another video, where the ingredients are put on the counter, matching the displayed ingredients - and it detects mismatches in the items.

Exciting to see this kind of vision, and I'm really curious how far away this is. We have face to face talk, interactive surfaces, touch screens, etc. Maybe 10 years from now, this will be the norm...
