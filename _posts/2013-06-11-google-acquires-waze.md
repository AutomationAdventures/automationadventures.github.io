Today Google [announced](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/google-maps-and-waze-outsmarting.html) the acquisition of Waze, the social driving app.

[Waze](http://www.waze.com/) allows users to not only get a route to their destination, but incorporate traffic reports from other Waze users, including stopped vehicles, debris on the road, and even police sightings. There is a gaming aspect to Waze, where users get points for miles driven and reporting traffic situations.

It will be interesting to see what Google will do with Waze. Will they incorporate aspects of Waze into Google Maps, and leave well enough alone, or will Waze be absorbed? Hopefully the community of Waze users will not be left in the cold, like the users of Google Reader were...
