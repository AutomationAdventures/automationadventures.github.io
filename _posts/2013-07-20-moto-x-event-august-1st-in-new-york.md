Motorola's next phone, the [Moto X](https://mediacenter.motorola.com/News-Bytes/Moto-X-The-First-Smartphone-Assembled-in-the-USA-3c2e.aspx), is scheduled to be presented to the world on August 1st, in New York.

The Moto X has been spotted in Eric Schmidt's hands, and last week an invitation-only NDA-covered presentation was held for a select few.

The new phone is completely manufactured in the US (although that probably means that it is assembled in the US, with components manufactured elsewhere), and is fully customizable.

Also, the Moto X is said to be the first Motorola phone completely designed and developed under Google's leadership over Motorola.

We hope that the Moto X will be the new Google Android reference phone, and will receive updates in a timely manner. The rest of the phone is becoming secondary...
