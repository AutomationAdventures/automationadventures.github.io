[XKCD](http://xkcd.com/) has this wonderful chart, showing how long you can spend on optimizing a process, depending on the time you save and how often you do it:

So if you save 1 minute of a daily process, and you spend less than a day on it, you'll save time in less than 5 years. Glad to know my 1 day effort on automating a daily process was well below the limit (6 days)...!
