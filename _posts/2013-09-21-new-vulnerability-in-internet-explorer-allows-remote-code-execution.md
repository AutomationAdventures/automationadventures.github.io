A new [Internet Explorer zero-day vulnerability](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2887505) is being exploited in the wild. Until Microsoft has evaluated all the information, they have released a [hot fix](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2887505/en-us). If you are using Internet Explorer (and it seems it doesn't matter what version, from 6 all the way up to the pre release 11), apply this hot fix in anticipation of the security patch.
