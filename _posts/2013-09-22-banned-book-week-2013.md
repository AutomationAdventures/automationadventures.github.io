_Something is on my mind that has only a passing relation to automation, but in the light of the [Snowden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden) revelations and the resulting attention to government surveillance, I think it's important to touch on this._

![Banned Books Week 2013](/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BBW13_300x250.jpg)

Today marks the start of [Banned Books Week](http://www.bannedbooksweek.org/), an event to call attention to the banning of books in the United States.

Yes, book banning.

Why? Because apparently [Fahrenheit 451](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451) (a banned book) scares people more as a book than as a scenario. Because [1984](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) (a banned book) apparently is too violent, rather than scary as a view of a total surveillance state (NSA surveillance, anyone?). Because [Ender's Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game) (a banned book) contains sex, something that doesn't happen in our world (wait - didn't it also contain a fair amount of violence? Oh right... banning books on the ground of violence would be weird, but banning them on the grounds of sex is perfectly reasonable).

I learned about Banned Books Week yesterday in our library, when my daughter asked why there was caution tape around a table with books. I was stunned to find books like A Brave New World, Animal Farm, 1984, The Great Gatsby and many, many more classics on the banned books list.

Although it's everyone's right to question books, I feel no one should have the ability to prevent others from reading certain books. Please [support](http://www.bannedbooksweek.org/support) your local library and the ALA in the Banned Books Week.
