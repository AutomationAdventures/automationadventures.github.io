I came across an [article](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2013/03/home-automation-with-angularjs-and-node-js-on-a-raspberry-pi/) recently on how to set up a simple Home Automation system using a Raspberry Pi with an RF transmitter attached to it, and node.js with Angular.js.

It's fairly primitive in that it is mainly a web interface to some light switches, but has the potential to grow into a real automation system. Keep an eye out for new releases (the author, [Dennis Schulte](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/author/dsc/), has given it version number 1.0, since the system is in production! ðŸ™‚
