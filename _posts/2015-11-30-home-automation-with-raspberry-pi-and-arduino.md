Instructable user electronichamsters has a very detailed instruction manual on how to create a home automation system that can:

  * Notify you when the mail arrives
  * Track your dog's poop and bark locations
  * Monitor for people in different parts of the house
  * Check for water leaks
  * Alert you when the dog runs away
  * Not only check when the washer or dryer is finished, but also if someone has been there already
  * Watch the temperature and humidity in different rooms
  * etc. etc.

using a Raspberry Pi, a few Arduino clones, some cheap sensors from eBay, and openHAB as the brains of the operation.
