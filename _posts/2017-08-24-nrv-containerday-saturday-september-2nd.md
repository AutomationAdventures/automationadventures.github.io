![alt text](/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nrv-logo.png "NRV logo")Some of you may know I've been dabbling in Docker, and specifically its usefulness in a Windows-centric environment. Michael Irwin has run a [Docker user group in the Blacksburg](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Blacksburg/) area for almost a year now. And to celebrate the first anniversary, he (and a few others) have organized a ContainerDay.

The day consists of 4 talks on Docker in general in the morning, and a workshop and a few blitz talks in the afternoon. The goal is to have every participant go home with a working Docker application. It is geared towards developers, but everyone is welcome.

Sign-up and participation are free, and the location is Torgerson Hall, Room 3100, on the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg.
